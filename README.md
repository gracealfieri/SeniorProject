Health Monitoring System
Our goal is to create a comprehensive health monitoring system. We would like to use the fitbit API to pull information from a fitbit onto a smartphone application. The smartphone application will send health data to a server where it will be stored for each individual. We will build a web front end using React and either PHP or Entity framework to interface with our database. We will allow the user to choose the refresh rate of the information.
